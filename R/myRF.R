# Package: varstar
# Function: myRF(known, unknown, ctrl, grid, keeps)

#Purpose: 
# 1. Builds a random forest model using the caret package, on the known data set.
# 2. Predicts class values for unknown set, using the trained rf model.
# 4. Returns error rates and confusion matrices for the known and unknown data sets.

#Input data set must have a variable called class.

#Inputs: 
#  known = data set with known labels.
#  unknown = data set with unknown labels.
#  ctrl = the trainControl statement (caret).
#  grid = the grid of .mtry values to use.  Optional, defaults to NULL.
#  keeps = the vector of feature names (including class) to consider in model.

#Output: A list object x, with components as follows.
#  x$model = Random forest model object (created using caret pckg).
#  x$classPred = Predicted class values for unknown data set.
#  x$conf_matrix_known = Confusion matrix for cross-validated model (on training set).
#  x$result = Accuracy for training model.
#  x$unknown.error = Error rate for applying model to unknown data.
#  x$conf_matrix_unknown = Confusion matrix for applying model to unknown data.

#' myRF: A Random Forest function
#'
#' This function builds a random forest classifier, predicts class values for the
#' unknown data set, and returns error rates and confusion matrices for the 
#' known and unknown data sets.
#'
#' @param known A data set with known classes, used to classify the unknown data set.
#' Defaults to NULL.
#' @param unknown A data set whose classes are considered unknown.  Classes will be 
#' predicted for this data set.  Defaults to NULL.
#' @param ctrl A trainControl statement from the caret package.  Defaults to NULL.
#' @param grid A grid for the tuneGrid parameter in the train (caret) function. Defaults to NULL.
#' @param keeps A vector of feature names to consider in the model (must include 'class'). 
#' Defaults to NULL.
#' @param samps A vector of sample sizes by class for the sampsize random forest argument.
#'
#' @keywords random forest variable star classification
#'
#' @return A list containing the following components:
#' @return x$model = Random forest model object (created using caret pckg).
#' @return x$classPred = Predicted class values for unknown data set.
#' @return x$conf_matrix_known = Confusion matrix for cross-validated model (on training set).

#' ## Define ctrl object.

#' ## Define list of features to keep, including 'class' as the first feature.
#' features <- c('class','feature1','feature2','feature3')
#' ## Known and Unknown data sets must contain a 'class' column.
